%\subtitle{[Extended Abstract]
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the "boxing"
% and alignment of the authors under the title, and to add
% a section for authors number 4 through n.
%
% Up to the first three authors are aligned under the title;
% use the \alignauthor commands below to handle those names
% and affiliations. Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% additional authors as the argument to \additionalauthors;
% these will be set for you without further effort on your
% part as the last section in the body of your article BEFORE
% References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{1}
%
% You can go ahead and credit authors number 4+ here;
% their names will appear in a section called
% "Additional Authors" just before the Appendices
% (if there are any) or Bibliography (if there
% aren't)

% Put no more than the first THREE authors in the \author command
%%You are free to format the authors in alternate ways if you have more 
%%than three authors.

\author{
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
%% e-mail address with \email.
