abstract="This chapter surveys phishing attacks and their countermeasures. We first examine the underlying ecosystem that facilitates these attacks. Then we go into some detail with regard to the techniques phishers use, the kind of brands they target, as well as variations on traditional attacks. Finally, we describe several proposed countermeasures to phishing attacks and their relative merits.",

abstract = { 'Phishing' is a fraudulent activity defined as the creation of a replica of an existing Web page to fool a user into submitting personal, financial, or password data. There are security service guidelines for both software security and web site security development environments. Developers use these guidelines when planning new systems (or during re-engineering of existing systems) to ensure a secure environment. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: firstly to consider the characteristics of a phishing attack and to identify a list of issues relevant to it; and secondly, to compare the nature of a phishing attack with the security services guidelines provided and to pinpoint the weakness(es) of phishing attacks if these guidelines are adhered to.},
